This a tooltip made to be used with Pokemon Showdown's Rated Random Battle mode using open source code from the Pokemon Showdown server.
The tooltip provides useful data on an enemy's item, ability, moves, and stats.
Data is expressed in percentages. This data changes dynamically as the enemy reveals some of their information over the course of a game.

Warnings

Use of the tooltip on anything but a Rated Random Battle will have no effect.
Only one game should be open at any time to avoid confusing the tooltip.
As time passes, this tooltip will become slightly outdated. Use at your own risk.

How to install

This is a Chrome Console Program. Therefore Google Chrome is required.
Right-click anywhere on Pokemon Showdown, and click on "Inspect". In the tabs on the near the top, click on Sources.
This should open a tab of "Sources", "Content Scripts", and "Snippets". If you only see 1 or 2, click on the ">>".
Select the "Snippets" tab, and create a new snippet. This should open a text box on the right side of your screen.
Copy/Paste the text of the tooltip file into this textbox. Be sure to hit Ctrl+S to save it, and viola!

How to run

To activate the tooltip, go to back to the snippet. Right-click the file "Script snippet #1" (or whatever you named it) and hit run.
The tooltip will remain activated until the tab is closed.

Issues

Sometimes you will see "No valid sets found!" This is usually normal behavior if the server randomly assigns a pokemon a set.
However if you see an invalid number or negative number, please report the issue at GitHub.
